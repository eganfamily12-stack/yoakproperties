"""How to Apply / FAQ page.

Content is Yoak's own FAQ, which until now lived in a Google Doc behind a
Linktree where no prospective tenant would find it and no search engine would
index it. Wording follows the source document closely.

Two deliberate departures from the source, both flagged in the README:
  * The source says monthly rent is paid through "the Resident Center App and
    Buildium account". Yoak has moved to AppFolio, so that sentence would send
    tenants to a decommissioned system. Because the resident portal is not being
    advertised on the public site yet, the line now states only when rent is due
    and says the leasing agent sets up payment at move-in.
  * The source names the payee as "Yoak Properties and Construction LLC", which
    differs from the "Co." used in the site branding. The payee line keeps the
    source's wording verbatim, because that is what a cashier's check must say.
